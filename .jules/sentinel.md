## 2024-05-22 - Prevent User Enumeration in Auth Flows
**Vulnerability:** Default error handling in `CognitoService` exposed user existence by returning 404 for `UserNotFoundException` vs 401 for `NotAuthorizedException` during login and forgot password flows.
**Learning:** Generic error mapping (useful for admin APIs) is dangerous for public authentication endpoints. Attackers could enumerate valid email addresses.
**Prevention:** Explicitly catch `UserNotFoundException` in public auth methods (`login`, `forgotPassword`) and return generic "Invalid credentials" (401) or silent success to mask user existence.
